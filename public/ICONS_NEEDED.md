# Icon Placeholder File

This file serves as a placeholder for the required SEO icons. 
You should replace these with actual optimized icon files:

## Required Icons for SEO:

1. **favicon.ico** (16x16, 32x32, 48x48 sizes in one file)
   - Used by browsers for tabs and bookmarks
   - Should be in the root public directory

2. **icon.svg** (scalable vector icon)
   - Modern browsers prefer SVG icons
   - Scales perfectly on any device

3. **apple-touch-icon.png** (180x180)
   - Used by iOS Safari for home screen icons
   - Should be exactly 180x180 pixels

4. **icon-192x192.png** (192x192)

   - Progressive Web App icon

5. **icon-512x512.png** (512x512)
